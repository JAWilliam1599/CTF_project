We reverse and see that it ask to access win to get the flag from bin/sh

we will exploit and access that by overriding the return address from the function bof. This function fget normally can not be exploited but since we only allocate 16 character from:
sub     rsp, 10h

And fget can accept 512 characters, so we can overriding return address.


It asks us to save the present so when we get to win, we can pass.
