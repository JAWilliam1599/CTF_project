if no arguments is passed, it will check cmp r12d, 1 (means no arguments), then it will print Usage: Riyadh flag

- rep stos %rax, (%es:%rdi)

stos means store string, or store a value in rax into rdi (stosb means byte, stosw means word, stosd means doubleword, stosq means quad)
rep means repeat rcx times
- rdi after being set will move based on DF (direction flag), if 0 then it means to move forward 8 bytes

So, if:
mov rax, 0
mov rcx, 1000
mov rdi, 0x1234		# destination 0x1234 in memory
rep stosq		# sets 1000 * 8 = 8000 bytes to 0
