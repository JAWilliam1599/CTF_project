looking at bof.c
we saw the stack layout is:
padding, buf, notsecret, secret

we assume that the stack layout is rbp, padding, buf, notsecret, secret, lower address ->
However, this is c source code not asm, so we need to run the program:
The program show that the order is:
buf
padding
secret
notsecret

We need to overwrite the secret to 0x67616c66
buf has 32 bytes, padding has 16 bytes
so we need to create the payload that overwrites first 48 bytes with something
then add the value in little-edian
-> the payload is:
payload = b'A' * 48 + b'\x66\x6c\x61\x67'

we get the flag:
CTFlearn{buffer_0verflows_4re_c00l!}
