Reading the code, we see that acc is an integer
So we can overflow to make acc a negative number

An interger is larger than 2,100,000,000 so we first input 2,100,000,000 than add another 100,000,000

acc = 0
Enter a number: 2100000000
acc = 2100000000
Enter a number: 400000000
You win! acc = -1794967296
