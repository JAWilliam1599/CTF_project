Use file and checksec, we have these infomation:

Patital RELRO and dynamically linked, we can do GOT overwrites

Have canary but a gets function with printf can leak that

The second is used to overwrite the return address with given print_flag (No PIE so no need to calculate)

Note: There is endbr64 which is to ensure to ROP attack, but since we runs at the beginning of func so no need to worry.

But need to pad another 8 bytes before canary for endbr64
