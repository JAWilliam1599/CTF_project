When disassemble we can see a very interesting thing:

mov     [rbp+rax+s], 0
lea     rdx, [rbp+s]
lea     rax, [rbp+command]
mov     rcx, rdx
lea     rdx, aDigSShort ; "dig %s +short"
mov     esi, 0FFh       ; maxlen
mov     rdi, rax        ; s
mov     eax, 0
call    _snprintf
lea     rax, [rbp+command]
mov     rdi, rax        ; command
call    _system

It called a function dig (stands for Domain information Groper) to get DNS query of a Domain
But we can inject shell code since this is unsantinized user input
We input ls -la

It said Invalid option: -la

So it treats the first is the arg to dig, so we input
google.com && cat flag.txt -> get out the flag

we get: CTFlearn{1s_c0mm4nd_1nj3ct10n_4_th1ng?}
